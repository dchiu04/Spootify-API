# Spootify API

Spootify API is a web api which allows users to add and search for their favourite music. It uses JSON requests to fetch and send data. The current version of the app is a prototype and external resources are necessary in order to use all of its capabilities such as creating and deleting new music. Any JSON request app will work with Spootify API such as https://www.postman.com/.

Using commands such as https://dry-sea-70637.herokuapp.com/music will show all music saved to the database.
